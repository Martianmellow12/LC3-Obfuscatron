<h1>LC-3 Obfuscatron</h1>
<h2>Writing LC-3 assembly sucks, so share some pain with the person grading it</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This program is pretty simple: it takes a compiled LC-3 .obj file and creates a new LC-3 .asm file that is the original program, but using nothing but the .FILL assembler instruction to create it. The new .asm file still compiles and runs, but it lacks comments or anything remotely close to human readable code.

Note: I don't take responsibility for any angry teachers, TAs, or professors, but be sure let me know if you get in trouble so we can laugh/sob together.
